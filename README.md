# AssemblyIntegerEncryption
A very simple project on assebly that "encrypts" an 4 digit number by adding 7 to each digit and keeping its mod10

Example:

Given the number "1246" the output will be :

1st Digit 1 -> (1+7)mod10 = 8
2st Digit 2 -> (2+7)mod10 = 9
3st Digit 4 -> (4+7)mod10 = 1
4st Digit 6 -> (6+7)mod10 = 3
